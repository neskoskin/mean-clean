# MEAN clean app

MEAN project configuration I use for development. Contains the directory structure and uses Gulp for js and less processing (bundling, ugli/minificaiton) and nodemon for running the express server. Brief descriptions of each folder placed in the corresponding `README.md` files.

`client` contains client-side code (styles/scripts) used in development. 

`server` contains all the Node scripts.

`public` contains the final scripts/styles/markup exposed to the front-end (scripts/styles are produced after Gulp processing).

`stash` contains duplicates/notes etc.

`build` contains intermediary processed files from the `client` directory.
